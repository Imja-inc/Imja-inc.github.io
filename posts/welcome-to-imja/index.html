    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This is an experiment in how I can have an impact in software engineering best practices, through training and improved tools. There&rsquo;s a few big things in the works, but the idea here is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We need to improve cross-team communication to deliver the best software</p></li>

<li><p>Save more time with better software, hacks cost lot more over longer time</p></li>

<li><p>Not everyone will read Fowler and Schneier and follow best practices. How do we train them to do that?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, I&rsquo;ll be doing a few things: writing more, and doing a lot of workshops on the cross-section of -&gt; Security, Leadership skills, Software Engineering. I am by no means an expert but I will be sharing what I learn in this journey.</p>

<p>This is a long bet, and every long bet starts with a failure. I want to fail at the right problems.</p>
